# RUST - Snake
A little project creating Snake in RUST using pancurses and basic standard libraries.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You need the RUST runtime installed

checkout directory
cd into it
cargo run
```

### How to play

I mean it's Snake :) 

Controls:

Move with w(up) a(left) s(down) d(right) , press and hold to get a temporary speed boost
q is quit

If you hit screen boundaries then the game over screen displays.  It's a smart snake so doesn't eat itself (feel free to add this if you like)...
