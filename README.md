# RUST - Snake
A little project creating Snake in RUST using pancurses and basic standard libraries.


## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You need the RUST runtime installed

checkout directory
cd into it
cargo run

## How to play

I mean it's Snake :) 

If you hit screen boundaries then it's Game Over 

It's a smart snake so doesn't eat itself (feel free to add this if you like)...

### Controls:
